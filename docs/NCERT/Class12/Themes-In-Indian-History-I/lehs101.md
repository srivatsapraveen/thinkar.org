## The Harappan Civilisation

### THEME

## ONE

```
The Harappan seal (Fig.1.1) is possibly the most
distinctive artefact of the Harappan or Indus valley
civilisation. Made of a stone called steatite, seals
like this one often contain animal motifs and signs
from a script that remains undeciphered. Yet we
know a great deal about the lives of the people who
lived in the region from what they left behind –
their houses, pots, ornaments, tools and seals – in
other words, from archaeological evidence. Let us
see what we know about the Harappan civilisation,
and how we know about it. We will explore how
archaeological material is interpreted and how
interpretations sometimes change. Of course, there
are some aspects of the civilisation that are as yet
unknown and may even remain so.
```
#### Terms, places, times

```
The Indus valley civilisation is also called the Harappan culture.
Archaeologists use the term “culture” for a group of objects,
distinctive in style, that are usually found together within a specific
geographical area and period of time. In the case of the Harappan
culture, these distinctive objects include seals, beads, weights, stone
blades (Fig. 1.2) and even baked bricks. These objects were found
from areas as far apart as Afghanistan, Jammu, Baluchistan
(Pakistan) and Gujarat (Map 1).
Named after Harappa, the first site where this unique culture
was discovered (p. 6), the civilisation is dated between c. 2600 and
1900 BCE. There were earlier and later cultures, often called Early
Harappan and Late Harappan, in the same area. The Harappan
civilisation is sometimes called the Mature Harappan culture to
distinguish it from these cultures.

## 1. Beginnings

```
There were several archaeological cultures in the
region prior to the Mature Harappan. These cultures
were associated with distinctive pottery, evidence of
agriculture and pastoralism, and some crafts.
Settlements were generally small, and there were
virtually no large buildings. It appears that there
was a break between the Early Harappan and the
Harappan civilisation, evident from large-scale
burning at some sites, as well as the abandonment
of certain settlements.
```
## 2. Subsistence Strategies

```
If you look at Maps 1 and 2 you will notice that the
Mature Harappan culture developed in some of the
areas occupied by the Early Harappan cultures.
These cultures also shared certain common elements
including subsistence strategies. The Harappans ate
a wide range of plant and animal products, including
fish. Archaeologists have been able to reconstruct
dietary practices from finds of charred grains and
seeds. These are studied by archaeo-botanists, who
are specialists in ancient plant remains. Grains

found at Harappan sites include
wheat, barley, lentil, chickpea
and sesame. Millets are found
from sites in Gujarat. Finds of
rice are relatively rare.
Animal bones found at Harappan
sites include those of cattle, sheep,
goat, buffalo and pig. Studies
done by archaeo-zoologists or zoo-
archaeologists indicate that these
animals were domesticated.
Bones of wild species such as
boar, deer and _gharial_ are
also found. We do not know
whether the Harappans hunted
these animals themselves or
obtained meat from other hunting
communities. Bones of fish and
fowl are also found.

2.1 Agricultural technologies

While the prevalence of
agriculture is indicated by finds
of grain, it is more difficult to
reconstruct actual agricultural practices. Were
seeds broadcast (scattered) on ploughed lands?
Representations on seals and terracotta sculpture
indicate that the bull was known, and
archaeologists extrapolate from this that oxen
were used for ploughing. Moreover, terracotta
models of the plough have been found at sites in
Cholistan and at Banawali (Haryana).
Archaeologists have also found evidence of a
ploughed field at Kalibangan (Rajasthan),
associated with Early Harappan levels (see p. 20).
The field had two sets of furrows at right angles to
each other, suggesting that two different crops
were grown together.
Archaeologists have also tried to identify the
tools used for harvesting. Did the Harappans use
stone blades set in wooden handles or did they use
metal tools?
Most Harappan sites are located in semi-arid
lands, where irrigation was probably required for
agriculture. Traces of canals have been found at
the Harappan site of Shortughai in Afghanistan, but
not in Punjab or Sind. It is possible that ancient

canals silted up long ago. It is also likely that water
drawn from wells was used for irrigation. Besides,
water reservoirs found in Dholavira (Gujarat) may
have been used to store water for agriculture.
```
#### How artefacts are identified

```
Processing of food required grinding equipment as well as vessels
for mixing, blending and cooking. These were made of stone, metal
and terracotta. This is an excerpt from one of the earliest reports on
excavations at Mohenjodaro, the best-known Harappan site:
```
```
Saddle querns ... are found in considerable numbers
... and they seem to have been the only means in use
for grinding cereals. As a rule, they were roughly made
of hard, gritty, igneous rock or sandstone and mostly
show signs of hard usage. As their bases are usually
convex, they must have been set in the earth or in
mud to prevent their rocking. Two main types have
been found: those on which another smaller stone was
pushed or rolled to and fro, and others with which a
second stone was used as a pounder, eventually
making a large cavity in the nether stone. Querns of
the former type were probably used solely for grain;
the second type possibly only for pounding herbs and
spices for making curries. In fact, stones of this latter
type are dubbed “curry stones” by our workmen and
our cook asked for the loan of one from the museum
for use in the kitchen.

Mohenjodaro, 1937.

## 3. Mohenjodaro

### A Planned Urban Centre

Perhaps the most unique feature of the Harappan
civilisation was the development of urban centres.
Let us look at one such centre, Mohenjodaro,
more closely. Although Mohenjodaro is the most
well-known site, the first site to be discovered
was Harappa.
The settlement is divided into two sections, one
smaller but higher and the other much larger but

metres
```

(^6) THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY

### The plight of Harappa

```
Although Harappa was the
first site to be discovered, it
was badly destroyed by brick
robbers. As early as 1875,
Alexander Cunningham, the
first Director-General of the
Archaeological Survey of
India (ASI), often called the
father of Indian archaeology,
noted that the amount
of brick taken from the
ancient site was enough
to lay bricks for “about
100 miles” of the railway
line between Lahore and
Multan. Thus, many of the
ancient structures at the site
were damaged. In contrast,
Mohenjodaro was far better
preserved.
```
```
lower. Archaeologists designate these as the Citadel
and the Lower Town respectively. The Citadel owes
its height to the fact that buildings were constructed
on mud brick platforms. It was walled, which
meant that it was physically separated from the
Lower Town.
The Lower Town was also walled. Several buildings
were built on platforms, which served as foundations.
It has been calculated that if one labourer moved
roughly a cubic metre of earth daily, just to put the
foundations in place it would have required four
million person-days, in other words, mobilising
labour on a very large scale.
Consider something else. Once the platforms were
in place, all building activity within the city was
restricted to a fixed area on the platforms. So it
seems that the settlement was first planned and
then implemented accordingly. Other signs of
planning include bricks, which, whether sun-dried
or baked, were of a standardised ratio, where the
length and breadth were four times and twice the
height respectively. Such bricks were used at all
Harappan settlements.
3.1 Laying out drains
One of the most distinctive features of Harappan
cities was the carefully planned drainage system. If
you look at the plan of the Lower Town you will notice
that roads and streets were laid out along an
approximate “grid” pattern, intersecting at right
angles. It seems that streets with drains were laid
out first and then houses built along them. If
domestic waste water had to flow into the street
drains, every house needed to have at least one wall
along a street.
```
### Citadels

```
While most Harappan settlements have a small high
western part and a larger lower eastern section, there
are variations. At sites such as Dholavira and Lothal
(Gujarat), the entire settlement was fortified, and
sections within the town were also separated by walls.
The Citadel within Lothal was not walled off, but was
built at a height.
```
_Fig. 1.

Notice the huge opening of the
drain.

3.2 Domestic architecture
The Lower Town at Mohenjodaro provides examples
of residential buildings. Many were centred on a
courtyard, with rooms on all sides. The courtyard
was probably the centre of activities such as cooking
and weaving, particularly during hot and dry
weather. What is also interesting is an apparent
concern for privacy: there are no windows in the
walls along the ground level. Besides, the main
entrance does not give a direct view of the interior
or the courtyard.
Every house had its own bathroom paved with
bricks, with drains connected through the wall to
the street drains. Some houses have remains of
staircases to reach a second storey or the roof. Many
houses had wells, often in a room that could be
reached from the outside and perhaps used by
passers-by. Scholars have estimated that the total
number of wells in Mohenjodaro was about 700.

#### The most ancient

#### system yet discovered

```
About the drains, Mackay
noted: “It is certainly the most
complete ancient system as yet
discovered.” Every house was
connected to the street drains.
The main channels were made
of bricks set in mortar and were
covered with loose bricks that
could be removed for cleaning.
In some cases, limestone was
used for the covers. House
drains first emptied into a sump
or cesspit into which solid
matter settled while waste water
flowed out into the street drains.
Very long drainage channels
were provided at intervals with
sumps for cleaning. It is a
wonder of archaeology that
“little heaps of material, mostly
sand, have frequently been
found lying alongside drainage
channels, which shows ... that
the debris was not always
carted away when the drain
was cleared”.
FROM ERNEST MACKAY, Early Indus
Civilisation, 1948.
```
```
Drainage systems were not
unique to the larger cities,
but were found in smaller
settlements as well. At Lothal
for example, while houses were
built of mud bricks, drains were
made of burnt bricks.

3.3 The Citadel
It is on the Citadel that we
find evidence of structures
that were probably used for
special public purposes.
These include the warehouse

- a massive structure of
which the lower brick
portions remain, while the
upper portions, probably
of wood, decayed long
ago – and the Great Bath.
    The Great Bath was a
large rectangular tank in a
courtyard surrounded by a
corridor on all four sides.
There were two flights of
steps on the north and
south leading into the tank,
which was made watertight
by setting bricks on edge
and using a mortar of
gypsum. There were rooms
on three sides, in one of
which was a large well.
Water from the tank flowed
into a huge drain. Across a
lane to the north lay a
smaller building with
eight bathrooms, four on
each side of a corridor,
with drains from each
bathroom connecting to a
drain that ran along the
corridor. The uniqueness of
the structure, as well as
the _context_ in which it
was found (the Citadel,
with several distinctive
buildings), has led scholars
to suggest that it was meant for some kind of a special
ritual bath.

## 4. Tracking Social Differences

4.1 Burials
Archaeologists generally use certain strategies to
find out whether there were social or economic
differences amongst people living within a particular
culture. These include studying burials. You are
probably familiar with the massive pyramids of
Egypt, some of which were contemporaneous with
the Harappan civilisation. Many of these pyramids
were royal burials, where enormous quantities of
wealth was buried.
At burials in Harappan sites the dead were
generally laid in pits. Sometimes, there were
differences in the way the burial pit was made – in
some instances, the hollowed-out spaces were lined
with bricks. Could these variations be an indication
of social differences? We are not sure.
Some graves contain pottery and ornaments,
perhaps indicating a belief that these could be used
in the afterlife. Jewellery has been found in burials
of both men and women. In fact, in the excavations
at the cemetery in Harappa in the mid-1980s, an
ornament consisting of three shell rings, a jasper
(a kind of semi-precious stone) bead and hundreds
of micro beads was found near the skull of a male.
In some instances the dead were buried with copper
mirrors. But on the whole, it appears that the
Harappans did not believe in burying precious things
with the dead.

4.2 Looking for “luxuries”
Another strategy to identify social differences is to
study artefacts, which archaeologists broadly
classify as utilitarian and luxuries. The first category
includes objects of daily use made fairly easily out
of ordinary materials such as stone or clay. These
include querns, pottery, needles, flesh-rubbers (body
scrubbers), etc., and are usually found distributed
throughout settlements. Archaeologists assume
objects were luxuries if they are rare or made from
costly, non-local materials or with complicated
technologies. Thus, little pots of faience (a material
made of ground sand or silica mixed with colour
and a gum and then fired) were probably considered
precious because they were difficult to make.
The situation becomes more complicated
when we find what seem to be articles of daily

```

```

```

(^10) THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY
use, such as spindle whorls made of rare materials
such as faience. Do we classify these as utilitarian
or luxuries?
If we study the distribution of such artefacts, we
find that rare objects made of valuable materials
are generally concentrated in large settlements like
Mohenjodaro and Harappa and are rarely found in
the smaller settlements. For example, miniature pots
of faience, perhaps used as perfume bottles, are found
mostly in Mohenjodaro and Harappa, and there are
none from small settlements like Kalibangan. Gold
too was rare, and as at present, probably precious –
all the gold jewellery found at Harappan sites was
recovered from hoards.

## 5. Finding Out About Craft

## Production

```
Locate Chanhudaro on Map 1. This is a tiny
settlement (less than 7 hectares) as compared to
Mohenjodaro (125 hectares), almost exclusively
devoted to craft production, including bead-making,
shell-cutting, metal-working, seal-making and
weight-making.
The variety of materials used to make beads is
remarkable: stones like carnelian (of a beautiful red
colour), jasper, crystal, quartz and steatite; metals
like copper, bronze and gold; and shell, faience and
terracotta or burnt clay. Some beads were made of
two or more stones, cemented together, some of stone
with gold caps. The shapes were numerous – disc-
shaped, cylindrical, spherical, barrel-shaped,
segmented. Some were decorated by incising or
painting, and some had designs etched onto them.
```
### Ü Discuss...

What are the modes of
disposal of the dead prevalent
at present? To what extent do
these represent social
differences?

```
Hoards are objects kept
carefully by people, often inside
containers such as pots. Such
hoards can be of jewellery or
metal objects saved for reuse
by metalworkers. If for some
reason the original owners do
not retrieve them, they remain
where they are left till some
archaeologist finds them.
```
_Fig. 1.
A tool and beads_


#### 11

Techniques for making beads differed according
to the material. Steatite, a very soft stone, was easily
worked. Some beads were moulded out of a paste
made with steatite powder. This permitted making a
variety of shapes, unlike the geometrical forms made
out of harder stones. How the steatite micro bead
was made remains a puzzle for archaeologists
studying ancient technology.
Archaeologists’ experiments have revealed that the
red colour of carnelian was obtained by firing the
yellowish raw material and beads at various stages
of production. Nodules were chipped into rough
shapes, and then finely flaked into the final form.
Grinding, polishing and drilling completed the
process. Specialised drills have been found at
Chanhudaro, Lothal and more recently at Dholavira.
If you locate Nageshwar and Balakot on Map 1,
you will notice that both settlements are near the
coast. These were specialised centres for making
shell objects – including bangles, ladles and
inlay – which were taken to other settlements.
Similarly, it is likely that finished products (such
as beads) from Chanhudaro and Lothal were taken
to the large urban centres such as Mohenjodaro
and Harappa.

```
5.1 Identifying centres
of production
In order to identify centres
of craft production,
archaeologists usually look
for the following: raw
material such as stone
nodules, whole shells, copper
ore; tools; unfinished
objects; rejects and waste
material. In fact, waste is
one of the best indicators
of craft work. For instance,
if shell or stone is cut to
make objects, then pieces
of these materials will be
discarded as waste at the
place of production.
```
```
Fig. 1.
Pottery
Some of these can be seen in the
National Museum, Delhi or in the
site museum at Lothal.
```
### Ü Discuss...

```
Should the stone artefacts
illustrated in the chapter be
considered as utilitarian
objects or as luxuries? Are
there any that may fall into
both categories?
```
#### BRICKS, BEADS AND BONES

```
Fig. 1.

```

(^12) THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY
Sometimes, larger waste pieces were used up to
make smaller objects, but minuscule bits were
usually left in the work area. These traces suggest
that apart from small, specialised centres, craft
production was also undertaken in large cities such
as Mohenjodaro and Harappa.

## 6. Strategies for Procuring

## Materials

```
As is obvious, a variety of materials was used for
craft production. While some such as clay were
locally available, many such as stone, timber and
metal had to be procured from outside the alluvial
plain. Terracotta toy models of bullock carts suggest
that this was one important means of transporting
goods and people across land routes. Riverine routes
along the Indus and its tributaries, as well as coastal
routes were also probably used.
```
```
6.1 Materials from the subcontinent and beyond
The Harappans procured materials for craft
production in various ways. For instance, they
established settlements such as Nageshwar and
Balakot in areas where shell was available. Other
such sites were Shortughai, in far-off Afghanistan,
near the best source of lapis lazuli, a blue stone
that was apparently very highly valued, and Lothal
which was near sources of carnelian (from Bharuch
in Gujarat), steatite (from south Rajasthan and north
Gujarat) and metal (from Rajasthan).
Another strategy for procuring raw materials may
have been to send expeditions to areas such as the
Khetri region of Rajasthan (for copper) and south
India (for gold). These expeditions established
communication with local communities. Occasional
finds of Harappan artefacts such as steatite micro
beads in these areas are indications of such contact.
There is evidence in the Khetri area for what
archaeologists call the Ganeshwar-Jodhpura culture,
with its distinctive non-Harappan pottery and
an unusual wealth of copper objects. It is possible
that the inhabitants of this region supplied copper
to the Harappans.
```
_Fig.1.
Copper and bronze vessels_


#### 13

6.2 Contact with distant lands
Recent archaeological finds suggest that copper was
also probably brought from Oman, on the south-
eastern tip of the Arabian peninsula. Chemical
analyses have shown that both the Omani copper
and Harappan artefacts have traces of nickel,
suggesting a common origin. There are other traces
of contact as well. A distinctive type of vessel, a
large Harappan jar coated with a thick layer of black
clay has been found at Omani sites. Such thick
coatings prevent the percolation of liquids. We do
not know what was carried in these vessels, but it
is possible that the Harappans exchanged the
contents of these vessels for Omani copper.
Mesopotamian texts datable to the third
millennium BCE refer to copper coming from
a region called Magan, perhaps a name for
Oman, and interestingly enough copper found at

Other archaeological
finds suggestive of long-
distance contacts include
Harappan seals, weights,
dice and beads. In this
context, it is worth noting
that Mesopotamian texts
mention contact with regions named Dilmun
(probably the island of Bahrain), Magan and
Meluhha, possibly the Harappan region. They
mention the products from Meluhha: carnelian,
lapis lazuli, copper, gold, and varieties of wood.
A Mesopotamian myth says of Meluhha: “May your
bird be the _haja_ -bird, may its call be heard in
the royal palace.” Some archaeologists think the
_haja_ -bird was the peacock. Did it get this name
from its call? It is likely that
communication with Oman,
Bahrain or Mesopotamia was
by sea. Mesopotamian texts
refer to Meluhha as a
land of seafarers. Besides,
we find depictions of ships
and boats on seals.

## 7. Seals, Script, Weights

```
7.1 Seals and sealings
Seals and sealings were used to facilitate long-
distance communication. Imagine a bag of goods
being sent from one place to another. Its mouth was
tied with rope and on the knot was affixed some wet
clay on which one or more seals were pressed,
leaving an impression. If the bag reached with
its sealing intact, it meant that it had not been
tampered with. The sealing also conveyed the identity
of the sender.
7.2 An enigmatic script
Harappan seals usually have a line of writing,
probably containing the name and title of the owner.
Scholars have also suggested that the motif
(generally an animal) conveyed a meaning to those
who could not read.
Most inscriptions are short, the longest containing
about 26 signs. Although the script remains
undeciphered to date, it was evidently not
alphabetical (where each sign stands for a vowel or
a consonant) as it has just too many signs –
somewhere between 375 and 400. It is apparent that
the script was written from right to left as some
seals show a wider spacing on the right and cramping
on the left, as if the engraver began working from
the right and then ran out of space.
Consider the variety of objects on which writing
has been found: seals, copper tools, rims of jars,
copper and terracotta tablets, jewellery, bone rods,
even an ancient signboard! Remember, there may
have been writing on perishable materials too. Could
this mean that literacy was widespread?
7.3 Weights
Exchanges were regulated by a precise system of
weights, usually made of a stone called chert and
generally cubical (Fig. 1.2), with no markings. The

lower denominations of weights were binary (1, 2, 4,
8, 16, 32, etc. up to 12,800), while the higher
denominations followed the decimal system. The
smaller weights were probably used for weighing
jewellery and beads. Metal scale-pans have also
been found.

## 8. Ancient Authority

```
There are indications of complex decisions being
taken and implemented in Harappan society. Take
for instance, the extraordinary uniformity of
Harappan artefacts as evident in pottery (Fig. 1.14),
seals, weights and bricks. Notably, bricks, though
obviously not produced in any single centre, were of
a uniform ratio throughout the region, from Jammu
to Gujarat. We have also seen that settlements were
strategically set up in specific locations for various
reasons. Besides, labour was mobilised for making
bricks and for the construction of massive walls
and platforms.
Who organised these activities?
```
```
8.1 Palaces and kings
If we look for a centre of power or for depictions of
people in power, archaeological records provide no
immediate answers. A large building found at
Mohenjodaro was labelled as a palace by
archaeologists but no spectacular finds were
associated with it. A stone statue was labelled and
continues to be known as the “priest-king”. This is
because archaeologists were familiar with
Mesopotamian history and its “priest-kings” and have
found parallels in the Indus region. But as we will
see (p.23), the ritual practices of the Harappan
civilisation are not well understood yet nor are there
any means of knowing whether those who performed
them also held political power.
Some archaeologists are of the opinion that
Harappan society had no rulers, and that everybody
enjoyed equal status. Others feel there was no single
ruler but several, that Mohenjodaro had a separate
ruler, Harappa another, and so forth. Yet others

material. As of now, the last theory seems the most
plausible, as it is unlikely that entire communities
could have collectively made and implemented such
complex decisions.
```
## 9. The End of the Civilisation

```
There is evidence that by c. 1800 BCE most of the Mature
Harappan sites in regions such as Cholistan had been
abandoned. Simultaneously, there was
an expansion of population into new
settlements in Gujarat, Haryana and
western Uttar Pradesh.
In the few Harappan sites that
continued to be occupied after 1900
BCE there appears to have been a
transformation of material culture,
marked by the disappearance of the
distinctive artefacts of the civilisation
```
- weights, seals, special beads.
Writing, long-distance trade, and
craft specialisation also disappeared.
In general, far fewer materials were
used to make far fewer things. House
construction techniques deteriorated
and large public structures were no
longer produced. Overall, artefacts
and settlements indicate a rural way
of life in what are called “Late
Harappan” or “successor cultures”.
    What brought about these
changes? Several explanations have
been put forward. These range from
climatic change, deforestation,
excessive floods, the shifting and/or drying up of
rivers, to overuse of the landscape. Some of these
“causes” may hold for certain settlements, but they
do not explain the collapse of the entire civilisation.
    It appears that a strong unifying element, perhaps
the Harappan state, came to an end. This is
evidenced by the disappearance of seals, the script,
distinctive beads and pottery, the shift from a
standardised weight system to the use of local
weights; and the decline and abandonment of cities.
The subcontinent would have to wait for over a
millennium for new cities to develop in a completely
different region.

#### Evidence of an “invasion”

```
Deadman Lane is a narrow alley, varying from 3 to 6 feet in width ... At the point
where the lane turns westward, part of a skull and the bones of the thorax and
upper arm of an adult were discovered, all in very friable condition, at a depth of
4 ft 2 in. The body lay on its back diagonally across the lane. Fifteen inches to the
west were a few fragments of a tiny skull. It is to these remains that the lane owes
its name.
FROM JOHN MARSHALL, Mohenjodaro and the Indus Civilisation, 1931.
```
```
Sixteen skeletons of people with the ornaments that they were wearing when they
died were found from the same part of Mohenjodaro in 1925.
```
```
Much later, in 1947, R.E.M. Wheeler, then Director-General of the ASI, tried to
correlate this archaeological evidence with that of the Rigveda, the earliest known
text in the subcontinent. He wrote:
```
```
The Rigveda mentions pur, meaning rampart, fort or stronghold. Indra, the Aryan
war-god is called puramdara, the fort-destroyer.
Where are – or were – these citadels? It has in the past been supposed that they
were mythical ... The recent excavation of Harappa may be thought to have
changed the picture. Here we have a highly evolved civilisation of essentially non-
Aryan type, now known to have employed massive fortifications ... What destroyed
this firmly settled civilisation? Climatic, economic or political deterioration may
have weakened it, but its ultimate extinction is more likely to have been completed
by deliberate and large-scale destruction. It may be no mere chance that at a late
period of Mohenjodaro men, women, and children, appear to have been
massacred there. On circumstantial evidence, Indra stands accused.
FROM R.E.M. WHEELER, “Harappa 1946”, Ancient India, 1947.
```
```
In the 1960s, the evidence of a massacre in Mohenjodaro was questioned by an
archaeologist named George Dales. He demonstrated that the skeletons found at the
site did not belong to the same period:
Whereas a couple of them definitely seem to indicate a slaughter, ... the bulk of
the bones were found in contexts suggesting burials of the sloppiest and most
irreverent nature. There is no destruction level covering the latest period of the
city, no sign of extensive burning, no bodies of warriors clad in armour and
surrounded by the weapons of war. The citadel, the only fortified part of the city,
yielded no evidence of a final defence.
FROM G.F. DALES, “The Mythical Massacre at Mohenjodaro”, Expediton, 1964.

## 10. Discovering the Harappan

## Civilisation

So far, we have examined facets of the Harappan
civilisation in the context of how archaeologists
have used evidence from material remains to
piece together parts of a fascinating history. However,
there is another story as well – about how
archaeologists “discovered” the civilisation.
When Harappan cities fell into ruin, people
gradually forgot all about them. When men and
women began living in the area millennia later, they
did not know what to make of the strange artefacts
that occasionally surfaced, washed by floods or
exposed by soil erosion, or turned up while ploughing
a field, or digging for treasure.

10.1 Cunningham’s confusion
When Cunningham, the first Director-General of the
ASI, began archaeological excavations in the mid-
nineteenth century, archaeologists preferred to use
the written word (texts and inscriptions) as a guide
to investigations. In fact, Cunningham’s main
interest was in the archaeology of the Early Historic
( _c_. sixth century BCE-fourth century CE) and later
periods. He used the accounts left by Chinese
Buddhist pilgrims who had visited the subcontinent
between the fourth and seventh centuries CE to locate
early settlements. Cunningham also collected,
documented and translated inscriptions found during
his surveys. When he excavated sites he tended to
recover artefacts that he thought had cultural value.
A site like Harappa, which was not part of the
itinerary of the Chinese pilgrims and was not known
as an Early Historic city, did not fit very neatly within
his framework of investigation. So, although
Harappan artefacts were found fairly often during
the nineteenth century and some of these reached
Cunningham, he did not realise how old these were.
A Harappan seal was given to Cunningham by an
Englishman. He noted the object, but unsuccessfully
tried to place it within the time-frame with which
he was familiar. This was because he, like many
others, thought that Indian history began with the
first cities in the Ganga valley (see Chapter 2). Given
his specific focus, it is not surprising that he missed
the significance of Harappa.

### Sites, mounds, layers

```
Archaeological sites are formed
through the production, use
and discarding of materials
and structures. When people
continue to live in the same
place, their constant use and
reuse of the landscape results
in the build up of occupational
debris, called a mound. Brief
or permanent abandonment
results in alteration of the
landscape by wind or water
activity and erosion. Occupations
are detected by traces of
ancient materials found in
layers, which differ from one
another in colour, texture and
the artefacts that are found
in them. Abandonment or
desertions, what are called
“sterile layers”, can be
identified by the absence of
such traces.
Generally, the lowest layers
are the oldest and the highest
are the most recent. The study
of these layers is called
stratigraphy. Artefacts found in
layers can be assigned to
specific cultural periods and
can thus provide the cultural
sequence for a site.
```
```
10.2 A new old civilisation
Subsequently, seals were discovered at Harappa by
archaeologists such as Daya Ram Sahni in the early
decades of the twentieth century, in layers that were
definitely much older than Early Historic levels. It
was then that their significance began to be realised.
Another archaeologist, Rakhal Das Banerji found
similar seals at Mohenjodaro, leading to the
conjecture that these sites were part of a single
archaeological culture. Based on these finds, in 1924,
John Marshall, Director-General of the ASI,
announced the discovery of a new civilisation in the
Indus valley to the world. As S.N. Roy noted in
The Story of Indian Archaeology, “Marshall left India
three thousand years older than he had found her.”
This was because similar, till-then-unidentified
seals were found at excavations at Mesopotamian
sites. It was then that the world knew not only of a
new civilisation, but also of one contemporaneous
with Mesopotamia.
In fact, John Marshall’s stint as Director-General
of the ASI marked a major change in Indian
archaeology. He was the first professional
archaeologist to work in India, and brought his
experience of working in Greece and Crete to the
field. More importantly, though like Cunningham he
too was interested in spectacular finds, he was
equally keen to look for patterns of everyday life.
Marshall tended to excavate along regular
horizontal units, measured uniformly throughout the
mound, ignoring the stratigraphy of the site. This
meant that all the artefacts recovered from the same
unit were grouped together, even if they were found
at different stratigraphic layers. As a result, valuable
```
```
Fig. 1.
The stratigraphy of a small mound
Notice that the layers are not exactly horizontal.
```

#### 21

information about the context of these finds was
irretrievably lost.

10.3 New techniques and questions
It was R.E.M. Wheeler, after he took over as Director-
General of the ASI in 1944, who rectified this
problem. Wheeler recognised that it was necessary
to follow the stratigraphy of the mound rather
than dig mechanically along uniform horizontal
lines. Moreover, as an ex-army brigadier, he brought
with him a military precision to the practice
of archaeology.
The frontiers of the Harappan civilisation have
little or no connection with present-day national
boundaries. However, with the partition of the
subcontinent and the creation of Pakistan, the major
sites are now in Pakistani territory. This has spurred
Indian archaeologists to try and locate sites in India.
An extensive survey in Kutch has revealed a number
of Harappan settlements and explorations in Punjab
and Haryana have added to the list of Harappan
sites. While Kalibangan, Lothal, Rakhi Garhi and
most recently Dholavira have been discovered,
explored and excavated as part of these efforts, fresh
explorations continue.
Over the decades, new issues have assumed
importance. Where some archaeologists are often
keen to obtain a cultural sequence, others try to
understand the logic underlying the location of
specific sites. They also grapple with the wealth of
artefacts, trying to figure out the functions these
may have served.
Since the 1980s, there has also been growing
international interest in Harappan archaeology.
Specialists from the subcontinent and abroad have
been jointly working at both Harappa and
Mohenjodaro. They are using modern scientific
techniques including surface exploration to recover
traces of clay, stone, metal and plant and animal
remains as well as to minutely analyse every scrap
of available evidence. These explorations promise to
yield interesting results in the future.

### Wheeler at Harappa

```
Early archaeologists were often
driven by a sense of adventure.
This is what Wheeler wrote
about his experience at
Harappa:
It was, I recall, on a warm
May night in 1944 that a four
miles’ tonga-ride brought me
as the newly appointed
Director General of the
Archaeological Survey with
my local Muslim officer from
a little railway-station labelled
“Harappa” along a deep
sand track to a small rest-
house beside the moonlit
mounds of the ancient site.
Warned by my anxious
colleague that we must start
our inspection at 5.30 next
morning and finish by 7.30
“after which it would be too
hot”, we turned in with the
dark figure of the punka-walla
crouched patiently in the
entrance and the night
air rent by innumerable
jackals in the neighbouring
wilderness.
Next morning, punctually
at 5.30, our little procession
started out towards the sandy
heaps. Within ten minutes I
stopped and rubbed my eyes
as I gazed upon the tallest
mound, scarcely trusting my
vision. Six hours later my
embarrassed staff and I were
still toiling with picks and
knives under the blazing sun,
the mad sahib (I am afraid)
setting a relentless pace.

## 11. Problems of Piecing Together

## the Past

```
As we have seen, it is not the Harappan script that
helps in understanding the ancient civilisation. Rather,
it is material evidence that allows archaeologists to
better reconstruct Harappan life. This material could
be pottery, tools, ornaments, household objects, etc.
Organic materials such as cloth, leather, wood and
reeds generally decompose, especially in tropical
regions. What survive are stone, burnt clay (or
terracotta), metal, etc.
It is also important to remember that only broken
or useless objects would have been thrown away.
Other things would probably have been recycled.
Consequently, valuable artefacts that are found
intact were either lost in the past or hoarded and
never retrieved. In other words, such finds are
accidental rather than typical.
11.1 Classifying finds
Recovering artefacts is just the beginning of the
archaeological enterprise. Archaeologists then
classify their finds. One simple principle of
classification is in terms of material, such as stone,
clay, metal, bone, ivory, etc. The second, and more
complicated, is in terms of function: archaeologists
have to decide whether, for instance, an artefact is
a tool or an ornament, or both, or something meant
for ritual use.
An understanding of the function of an artefact is
often shaped by its resemblance with present-day
things – beads, querns, stone blades and pots are
obvious examples. Archaeologists also try to identify
the function of an artefact by investigating the
context in which it was found: was it found in a
house, in a drain, in a grave, in a kiln?
Sometimes, archaeologists have to take recourse
to indirect evidence. For instance, though there are
traces of cotton at some Harappan sites, to find out
about clothing we have to depend on indirect
evidence including depictions in sculpture.
Archaeologists have to develop frames of reference.
We have seen that the first Harappan seal that was
found could not be understood till archaeologists had
a context in which to place it – both in terms of the
cultural sequence in which it was found, and in
terms of a comparison with finds in Mesopotamia.
```

#### 23

11.2 Problems of interpretation
The problems of archaeological interpretation are
perhaps most evident in attempts to reconstruct
religious practices. Early archaeologists thought that
certain objects which seemed unusual or unfamiliar
may have had a religious significance. These included
terracotta figurines of women, heavily jewelled, some
with elaborate head-dresses. These were regarded
as mother goddesses. Rare stone statuary of men in
an almost standardised posture, seated with one
hand on the knee – such as the “priest-king” – was
also similarly classified. In other instances,
structures have been assigned ritual significance.
These include the Great Bath and fire altars found
at Kalibangan and Lothal.
Attempts have also been made to reconstruct
religious beliefs and practices by examining seals,
some of which seem to depict ritual scenes. Others,
with plant motifs, are thought to indicate nature
worship. Some animals – such as the one-horned
animal, often called the “unicorn” – depicted on seals
seem to be mythical, composite creatures. In some
seals, a figure shown seated cross-legged in a “yogic”
posture, sometimes surrounded by animals, has
been regarded as a depiction of “proto-Shiva”, that
is, an early form of one of the major deities of
Hinduism. Besides, conical stone objects have been
classified as _lingas_.
Many reconstructions of Harappan religion are
made on the assumption that later traditions provide
parallels with earlier ones. This is because
archaeologists often move from the known to the
unknown, that is, from the present to the past. While
this is plausible in the case of stone querns and
pots, it becomes more speculative when we extend
it to “religious” symbols.
Let us look, for instance, at the “proto-Shiva” seals.
The earliest religious text, the _Rigveda_ (compiled _c_.
1500-1000 BCE) mentions a god named Rudra, which
is a name used for Shiva in later Puranic traditions
(in the first millennium CE; see also Chapter 4).
However, unlike Shiva, Rudra in the _Rigveda_ is
neither depicted as Pashupati (lord of animals in
general and cattle in particular), nor as a yogi_._ In
other words, this depiction does not match the
description of Rudra in the _Rigveda_. Is this, then,
possibly a shaman as some scholars have suggested?
