The Ice Cream Man - A Poem

When summer’s in the city,
And brick’s a blaze of heat,
The Ice-cream Man with his little cart
Goes trundling down the street.
Beneath his round umbrella,
Oh, what a joyful sight,
To see him fill the cones with mounds
Of cooling brown and white:
Vanilla, chocolate, strawberry,
Or chilly things to drink
From bottles full of frosty-fizz,
Green, orange, white, or pink.
His cart might be a flower bed,
Of roses and sweet peas,
The way the children cluster round
As thick as honeybees.
